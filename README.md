Scope of this project is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, two probabilities of prediction to be made;

1. h1n1_vaccine receiver
2. seasonal_vaccine receiver
Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey conducted by the USA government. This data obtained from https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/210/ competition.
